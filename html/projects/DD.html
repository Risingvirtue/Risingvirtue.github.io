		<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>In this project, I worked with a partner to implement a database management system. This includes 
				taking in commands, parsing them, and executing them if they are valid. The system itself should be 
				able to create tables, save/load/delete tables, print tables, and select tables. We were initially given
				an incomplete parser for commands and an empty database class.
			</p>
		<h2>Parse and Functions</h2>
			<p>I worked mostly on parse, modifying our given parser to make it more robust (being able to handle whitespaee) 
				and connecting each distinct valid command to a function that takes in specific variables. The initial parser
				had no sense of database keywords such as CREATE verse names of tables and actions. I created a helper parser that
				extracted information from valid commands and funneled that into their respective functions.
			</p>
		<h2>Database and Tables</h2>
			<p>The core of the project lied in the database. Every time there is a valid command, it passes its parameters
			into a method in the table class. The table class consists of a table structure with arrays that store valid entries.
			It also has methods to add and remove entries from a table easily. 
			
			Most of the methods such as create and save were pretty standard. The hardest method to implement was select. 
			In order to implement select, an inner join helper function was needed. The inner join function compared two tables
			and joined them into a temporary third table with similar elements based on the parameters. 
			</p>
			
		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>Finally, the end product is able to act like a database while storing and using tables.
