		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		Shooter is a mini project where I toyed around with mouse cursor location, user input, and unit collision. It is a 
		game where you are a player in a top down shooter trying to eliminate enemies. Controls are W,A,S,D to move and left
		click to shoot.
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<h2>Movement and User Inputs</h2>
		My initial movement implementation used a keyboard event listener that detected when the movement keys (W,A,S,D) were
		pressed and changed the coordinates of the controller manually. This lead to sticky and unnatural movements. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Instead, I used an animation frame that updated location every frame and used the keyboard event listener as a helper 
		to identifywhich keys were pushed down at that particular frame in time. This worked a lot better, and along with 
		momentum, created a smooth experience.
		
		
		<br>
		<br>
		<h2>Collision</h2>
		Collision for circular objects is pretty simple: if the distance between them is less than the sum of their radii, 
		they collide. The difficultly was in creating new enemies that didn't collide (a way to keep track) and implementing
		a damage system that continued with collision.
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		This is an ongoing prototype. Features that I want to add are: a workable restart button, movement in enemies, and enemy fire.
