		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		Bear Maps is a project where we construct the backend of a google maps clone of the city of Berkeley. The final product 
		has a zoom feature for zooming into a specific regions of the map and a routing feature for closest route between two locations
		on the map.
		<br>
		<br>
		Initially, I was given all of the front end such as MapServer.class that interacted with Apache Maven. This project 
		was to showcase my knowledge on data structures and expertise in Java as it's the final project of the class.
		<br>
		<br>
		Most of my coding is done inside the target/classes/example folder. The project had three parts: 
		rastering, routing and search.
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<h2>Rastering</h2>
		Rastering consisted of converting information to a bit-mapped, pixel by pixel image. Given a target region on the
		map, I needed to give the images that relayed that information for the correct zoom and correct order. My implementation
		was a quadtree class where each node is an image that had four children (one for each quadrant with an extra level of zoom). 
		It has its initial image as the entire map of Berkeley and zoomed in, getting the image name when needed.
		A lot of my time was spent creating the quadtree and understanding the inherent structure enough to find the 
		nodes that matched the upper left corner and bottom right corner of the target region. Then it was a simple matter
		of finding all the nodes inbetween.
		<br>
		<br>
		For trying to make runtime faster, I implemented pruning, travelling only to where the images are in the selected region.
		This cut the runtime down pretty far. 
		<br>
		<br>
		<h2>Routing</h2>
		The next part required accessing data from an XML file for road names and attributes via references. Because this would be 
		used for the final part of the code with finding optimal route, I had to create a class of nodes that stored information like
		previous node and current distance.
		<br>
		<br>
		The final part was implementing A* on the roads to find the optimal route. The hardest part was trying to optimize the runtime
		with keeping track of nodes that were already seen. I had weird implementation bugs where I would either go in loops or just end
		up completely in the wrong path. It took quite a while of debugging to get A* to work.
		<br>
		<br>
		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		Finally: the finished product could find the closest route and have a good UI for zooming in and out!
