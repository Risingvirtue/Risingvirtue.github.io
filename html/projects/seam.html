		<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>In this project, I devised a way to carve seams through an image. This is useful for shrinking images without losing
			much information. Each seam should be one pixel of width or height connected with one another. Everytime an image shrinks 
			in width or height, a selective seam is removed.
			</p>
		<h2>Energy</h2>
			<p>The energy is easily calculated. For each pixel, the energy is the sum of the difference squared of all the pixels surrounding it.
			</p>
		<h2>Algorithm and Seam Carving</h2>
			<p>Finding seams was a much more difficult task. A correct vertical seam corresponds to the minimum energy path from top to bottom. Each pixel 
			must be adjacent (or at a diagonal) to each other pixel in the path. The trick is the work from the bottom of the seam to the top, adding
			the minimum path for each bottom pixel and deciding which path has the lower energy total.
			
			The seam is then removed is the process repeats until the image is small enough. Horizonal seams were similar in approach, with the matrix of pixels just transposed.
			</p>
			
		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Finally, the end product is able to reduce images in size without much loss of information.
