		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		Dodge This! is a mini project that I coded while enroute a two hour plane ride. It was initially inspired by 
		Ikaruga's unique color changing system where your ship cannot be hit by objects of the same color. 
		I designed this game with nothing but a notebook and pencil and later implemented through javascript.
		Controls are (W,A,S,D) to move and left click to change color.
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<h2>Movement and User Inputs</h2>
		I used similar movement mechanics as in <a href="./shooter.html">Shooter</a>. User inputs are complex as in shooter,
		only needing the left mouse button to play the game.
		<br>
		<br>
		<h3>Collision</h3>
		Collision was also similar to shooter. However, there was a big difference, when objects bounce off each other, their
		trajectories change. Currently, changing the velocities is still a work in progress. Objects that overlap or collide in 
		one frame will move a time step in the future with altered velocities so that they don't occupy similar spaces after bouncing.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		This is an ongoing prototype. Features that I want to add are: correct implementation of bounce and a spacebar ability that teleports 
		your player to a fixed distance away.
